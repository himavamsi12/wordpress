= How to effectively use testimonials =

One of the most important tasks of your website is to educate potential customers of your product and/or service. Using effective testimonials is an important step in this process and highlighting the right testimonials is of the utmost importance.

Did you know that 90% of people trust testimonials from people they know, and that 70% of people trust testimonials of strangers posted online? (Neilsen, 2009)

* Testimonials build trust. Nothing is more trustworthy than seeing a real person talking highly of your product or service
* Testimonials can answer important questions
* Testimonials overcome buyer skepticism by showing how your product has helped others
* A testimonial can substantiate claims that you have made on your website
* By including a first name, last name and company name in the testimonial, you are showing that your testimonials are coming from real people
